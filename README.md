Can we save the SONY computer?

TEAM Member: M1 Jacob Laster (leader), M2 Peyton, and M2 Ciara

Hello from Jake.

In this part of the project, please describe the possible solutions to the dead SONY laptop.

Solution: The laptop was repaired in Dr. Li's office

Update: After our first breakdown of the Sony, we came across some technical issues involving startup. However, after further inspection we discovered the problem was due to the CPU being improperly seated. 

If you tell your customers that his/her computer cannot be saved. Your customer says, "What can I do with this junk?". What
are your responses?

Solution: The customer would most likely be able to salvage the RAM, the hard drive (hard disk), the laptop charger (the power cord), and possibly the battery.

In the following paragraphs, please list all the component names and their possible manufacturing years and the countries that made them. It is no surprise that most of them are made in China, Taiwan or South Korea.

Solution: Project results are listed below

Abstract:
The description below focuses on the folling points and discoveries made by Team Sony: part description, similarities and differences between desktop and laptop components, manufacturing origins, and date of manufacturing.

Description:
  During the course of the project Team Sony underwent a few challenges. While our original intent was to give a diagnostic of the computer and compare the parts we came across a few unexpected obstacles, one item in particular being a disc lodged inside the computer (it was located between the top of the shell and above the disc tray). After finally disassembling the machine we discovered that all the main compenents were similiar to that of a desktop; however, one major contrast was that a majority of the compenents were a compact version of their desktop counterparts. Another point of notice is that some of the parts are intergrated together. For example, in laptop the hardware devices, The CPU, the heatsink, and the fan are all connected together where as in a desktop they are separate items.
  Adittionally, most of the hardware is smaller in scale in comparison and is arguably half the size of regular compenents, yet the capacity of the parts are not limited by their inovation. As far as the component function themselves, everything seemed to function the same aside from the touch pad mouse.
