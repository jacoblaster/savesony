Hello from Jake.

In this part of the project, please describe the possible solutions to the dead SONY laptop.

Solution: The laptop was repaired in Dr. Li's office

If you tell your customers that his/her computer cannot be saved. Your customer says, "What can I do with this junk?". What

Solution: The customer would most likely be able to salvage the RAM, the hard drive (hard disk), the laptop charger (the power cord), and possibly the battery.

In the following paragraphs, please list all the component names and their possible manufacturing years and the countries that made them. It is no surprise that most of them are made in China, Taiwan or South Korea.

Solution: Project results are listed below
